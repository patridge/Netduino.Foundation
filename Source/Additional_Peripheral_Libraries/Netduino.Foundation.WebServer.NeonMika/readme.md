# NeonMike Web Server

The NeonMika web server source code has been moved from CodePlex in order to preserve the code as Codeplex is due for retirement in December 2017.

## Description

Hey guys,

NeonMika.Webserver is an pre-setup and easy to extend webserver. With minimal (to no) code you can achieve great results controlling your Netduino+, accessing and uploading files, create WebServices and more!

It's supports:

SD card access
Controlling your Netduino using existing methods like setPWM or setDigitalPinState
Adding your own webservice-like methods so you can expand NeonMika.Webserver to your own needs for every project.
Add more
Go to the Documentation page to find everything that gets you started with NeonMika.Webserver.

Have a look at the NeonMika.Webserver thread in the Netduion forum: http://forums.netduino.com/index.php?/topic/2889-neonmikawebserver/ if you have any further question or want to discuss about the code.

Greets, Markus
